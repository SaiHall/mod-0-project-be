## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
> My workflow felt about the same, because I got into 'the zone' and neglected some breaks... I should probably set alarms on my phone, if I intend to try that again.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
> I'd say my time estimations were a bit off. I ended up forgetting to account for making meals, or interruptions just from my ambient household. I did meet my goals, just a little after I had intended to. I think I need to account for more breaks, and maybe slightly longer ones.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
> A hash is a collection of information tied to specific keys. It differs from an Array in that an array can call on certain entries only using it's index, but a hash can only call on values associated with a key.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
> ```ruby

pet_store = {"pet food" => 89, "cats" => 7, "fish" => 1048}

```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
> I would use `states["IA"]` to lead to `"Iowa"``.

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
> `states.keys` would give you all the keys in the hash, and `states.values` would allow you to access all the values.
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
> A hash is better than an array in a menu, because you can call on a specific day, say Monday, and have it print out the menu options for that day. An array wouldn't allow you to do that as easily, and you might have to have many different arrays for each day to achieve the same thing. You can also use the hash to further go down the line and offer more detail by nesting it.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
> I suppose I'd like to see a few more examples of real-life hashes, so that I can better slot their uses into my mind. I understand them generally, but I'd like to see one 'in use'.
