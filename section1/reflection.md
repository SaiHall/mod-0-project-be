## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
>If I'm doing solo work, I tend to spend too long trying different things to fix it before I ask questions.
>I will have to put some work in, and set some timers, to get out of this habit.
>If I'm working in pairs or with a small group, I have the habit of blurting out the questions as I'm thinking aloud, so I will also have to work in that.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
>I would run `puts "Hello World!"`.

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
> An octothorpe is used to indicated comments. A pound sign, a number sign, a hash mark. (#)

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
> An integer is a whole number, and a float is a number including the decimal. 4 is an integer, whereas 4.5 is a float.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
> `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
> `p animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
> Interpolation is a way to reference variables that have been defined from within a string, using their variable names.
> `p "Deborah's favorite animal is the #{animal}."`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
> The 'gets' method is how we get input from the user. `input = gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
> 'chomp'- this method removed the line break (\n) from the end of a string.
> 'to_i'- this method translates a number in a string `"3"` to an integer `3`, which then becomes usable in equations.
